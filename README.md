#  Work Day Scheduler
 
***

During this challenge, I was given the task to create a calendar for a user during average work hours. Each hour is color-coded, representing whether it's the current hour, the past or the future. The user is able to add text in each hour-block and save it by pressing the blue button on the right side.

## Work Completed 

***

* Used bootstrap to format the time-blocks 
* Used the col-md function for each block
* Used the localStorage.getItem function to store text
